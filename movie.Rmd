## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
x = 1
```

```{r}
library(magrittr)
```

```{r}
movies = read.csv('movies.csv')

View(movies)
```

```{r}

ratings = read.csv('ratings.csv')
View(ratings)

```

```{r}

links = read.csv('links.csv')
View(links)

```

```{r}

tags = read.csv('tags.csv')
View(tags)

```

```{r}

genome_scores = read.csv('genome-scores.csv')
View(genome_scores)

```

```{r}

genome_tags = read.csv('genome-tags.csv')
View(genome_tags)

```












## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
